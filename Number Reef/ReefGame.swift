//  ReefGame.swift
//  Number Reef
//
//  The reef playing surface: the sum sits on a piece of coral on the sea floor,
//  the coral releases answer bubbles at irregular intervals, and the player
//  steers a fish into the bubble carrying the right answer.
//
//  This file holds the whole of the new gameplay and nothing else. Every rule
//  about scoring, lives, rounds and progress still lives in `MemoryGame`; this
//  scene only decides *when* an answer is touched and hands that answer over.
//  Wrong bubbles are free to drift off the top of the screen — reaching them is
//  never required.
